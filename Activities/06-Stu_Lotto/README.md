# The VBA Lotto

## Instructions

* You are in charge of finding our winners for a local lotto drawing.

  * The results are, in order:

    * First: 9008046
    * Second: 8768821
    * Third: 9195830

  * Create a script that will return those lucky winners and print them on the sheet.

    * For each winner include the following pieces of information:

      * First name
      * Last name
      * The winning number

    * They should be placed in winning order of First, Second, Third.

    * There should also be a message box that congratulates the first place winner.

## Bonus

* There may just be one other winner! The below numbers are Wild Lotto Balls. Whichever comes up first in the list will be the fourth place (runner-up) winner.

  * 9632462
